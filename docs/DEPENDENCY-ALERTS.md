# Dependency alerts

Every alert gets read and the reading gets written down here, **including "no
exposure"** — that entry is what records that somebody looked.

A standing red count with nobody looking is worse than no scanner at all: it
trains everyone to scroll past the one that matters. If this file is empty and
the alert count is not zero, the process has stopped working.

## How to triage one

1. Is the vulnerable code path reachable from this package? Most alerts on a
   build-time dependency are not.
2. Is there a fix that does not move a major version?
3. **Never take `npm audit`'s advice unread.** On the sibling project its
   proposed remedy for one alert was to move a runtime dependency back three
   major versions.
4. Record the decision below with the date, whatever it was.

## Log

| Date | Alert | Reading | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-08-26 | none open at the time Dependabot was switched on | Baseline entry. Two runtime dependencies, `jszip` and `@xmldom/xmldom`, both read package bytes the user supplies, so both are genuinely reachable and worth watching. | Watching |
